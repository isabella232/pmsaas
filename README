********************************************

Project Management SaaS, or short PMSaaS , is a tool for project management. 
The User can create new projects and employee accounts, add work packages 
and tasks to projects, assign employees to tasks, book hours for them, 
compare the booked hours to the planned PMs, weight each month differently 
and add expenses. The project can be edited, shared with other users and 
archived. To make it easier to keep track of all these things, the tool 
generates different graphs.
